# Go functional programming

The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of utility functions to allow for more functional code to be written in Go. Every export will be either a function, or an immutable type that can be operated on with functions. If there is any missing functionality that you would like to see, feel free to leave a Github issue detailing the functionality and its use!
